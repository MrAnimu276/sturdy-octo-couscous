<h1>Dark souls lore</h1>
<p>Im making this website to talk about lore of the dark souls game series. and by doing this i will shed some light on misinterpreted
  things like Artorias is left handed even though in the boss fight he weilds his sword in his right hand when his left is broken
  and it is said that unable carry his shield anymore due to his broken arm so stop saying he's left handed.</p>
